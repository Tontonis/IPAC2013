\small{
During the 2011 run of the LHC there was a significant measured temperature increase in the LHC Injection Kicker Magnets (MKI) during operation with 50ns bunch spacing. This was due to increased beam-induced heating of the magnet due to beam impedance. Due to concerns about future heating with the increased total intensity to nominal and ultimate luminosities a review of the impedance reduction techniques within the MKI was required. A number of new beam screen designs are proposed and their impedance evaluated. Heating estimates are also given with particular attention paid to future intensity upgrades to ultimate parameters.

	\begin{block}{LHC-MKI and Beam Screen Designs}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{The MKIs have recently been observed to undergo significant temperature rise during the increase of the stored intensity in the LHC [1]. This has been confirmed to be due to beam-induced heating via interaction between the circulating beam and the beam-coupling impedance of the MKIs}
	\item{The beam-coupling impedance of the MKIs is dominated by the beam screen (see Fig.~\ref{fig:short-screens}); an alumina "carrier" tube into which are inserted a number of conductive strips.}

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:short-screens}
\caption{Illustrating the layout of the beam screen, with the screen conductors electrically connected to the beam pipe at one end of the screen, and capacitively coupled to the beam pipe at the other by an overlapping external metallisation.}
\end{figure}

\item{Due to high voltage breakdown in the beam screen, most MKIs have had the 9 screen conductors closest to the HV plate removed. This causes an increase of the beam impedance, and thus increased heating.}

\end{figure}
\item{A number of different beam screen configurations are considered to reduce the beam impedance and avoid electrical breakdown in the beam screen (see Fig.~2).}

\label{fig:kicker_xsec}
\caption{A cross section of the simulation model of the MKI. We see the transmission line kicker magnet structure with high voltage and ground plates, with capactive plates in between. In red we see the ferrite yolk, and damping ferrites at the end of the structure to damp $\lambda/4$ resonances of the screen conductors. The beam screen runs through the centre of the ferrite yoke.}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item{The simulations of the beam coupling impedance of the MKI use a simplified model of the kicker magnet and vacuum tank (see Fig.~3), simulated interacting with a gaussian bunch of $\sigma_{z}=60mm$ in the time domain with the code CST Particle Studio. An integrated wake of 15m was used, using a mesh of $\approx$28 million cells.}

\begin{block}{Coaxial Wire Measurements}
\begin{itemize}
\item{We compare measurements to simulations to verify the validity of the simulation model. We take the example of 15 screen conductors, which has existing measurement data (see Fig.~\ref{fig:meas_sim_comp}). We can see the agreement is very good over a substantial part of the frequency range considered.}

\begin{block}{Beam Coupling Impedance of Beam Screen Designs}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Fig.~\ref{fig:screen_cond}(a) shows the impedance of the beam screen with different numbers of screen conductors. It can be seen that even a small amount of additional screening can contribute quite significantly to reducing the impedance of the MKI. The screening is especially effective at low frequencies where the beam current spectrum is high.}

\label{fig:screen_cond}
\end{figure}

\item{Fig.~\ref{fig:new-screens} shows the beam coupling impedance of a number of alternative screen designs compared to the present design with 24 screen conductors in place. We can see that all of these designs exhibit the same resonant structure, this being determined largely by the dimensions of the overlap between the screen conductors and the external metallisation. Work is underway to understand these resonances as a product of open-ended $\lambda/2$ resonators.}

\begin{block}{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item{We have demonstrated a number of alternative beam screen designs for the LHC MKIs, in particular designs optimised to reduce electrical breakdown have been demonstrated to provide comparable heat loads as the original.}
\item{Using modern simulation tools it is possible to simulate very large and complex structures to produce results in good agreement with measurements.}
