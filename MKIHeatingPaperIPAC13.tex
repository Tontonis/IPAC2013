\begin{abstract}
The LHC injection kicker magnets (MKIs) have experienced a significant degree of beam induced heating since the beginning of the 2011 due to the increasing intensity stored in the LHC, for long periods of time, and the relatively large broadband impedance of the installed kicker magnets. In this paper we show the sources of impedance in the MKIs, especially the effect that the beam screen dimensions have on the impedance. We show how these alter the power loss, and present an improved beam screen design that improves shielding on the magnet, whilst further improving electrical breakdown.
